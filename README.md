# Split Evaluator service

This services exposes a set of APIs to produce server side evaluation of flags by wrapping a NodeJS SDK.

## Usage with NodeJS

1. `nvm use`
2. `npm install`
3. `SPLIT_EVALUATOR_API_KEY=xxxxxxx SPLIT_EVALUATOR_AUTH_TOKEN=yyyyyy SPLIT_EVALUATOR_SERVER_PORT=7548 SPLIT_EVALUATOR_LOG_LEVEL=debug npm start`

   SPLIT_EVALUATOR_API_KEY could be overriden quickly, but we recommend the usage of [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config#quick-start),
   switch the environment variable NODE_ENV. Please read the details [here](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config#quick-start).  
   SPLIT_EVALUATOR_AUTH_TOKEN could be any value you like, against which we will compare the received Authorization header.
   SPLIT_EVALUATOR_SERVER_PORT is the port number on which the server will run, default is 7548.

`docker build -t splitsoftware/split-evaluator:<VERSION> . && docker build -t splitsoftware/split-evaluator:latest .`
